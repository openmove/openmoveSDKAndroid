/**
 * NUCLEUS API
 * OpenMove public APIs documentation. NUCLEUS API exposes a set of APIs tuned to support efficient and easy integration with any customer and to provide the best experience for users. We would welcome the opportunity to refine the specifications better to match your use case. These APIs have a thin nature in order to answer focused questions with very short response times. Some of these APIs also assume a user context, which will allow rolling various IDâ€™s (such as stopId) between requests.
